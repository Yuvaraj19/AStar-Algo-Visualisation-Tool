# AStar-Algo-Visualisation-Tool

A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.

Informally speaking, A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms. This fact is cleared in detail in below sections. 
And it is also worth mentioning that many games and web-based maps use this algorithm to find the shortest path very efficiently.

And this is a Visualisation tool made with Python-pygame module, It works as follows :
-> 1st left click creates a source on grid, 2nd creates a destination,
-> After creating source and destination, we can draw some black blocks in between which acts as obstacles,
-> And then by pressing space bar, the Visualisation starts and at the end by pressing 'c' clears the gird.
